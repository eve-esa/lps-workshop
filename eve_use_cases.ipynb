    "# Use Case Demonstration of EVE\n",
    "In this notebook, we explore practical applications of [EVE](https://eve.philab.esa.int/) (Earth Virtual Expert), a large language model specialized in Earth Observation (EO). EVE is designed to understand, analyze, and generate text related to EO data and topics, making it a valuable tool for researchers, analysts, and decision-makers in the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Register for our EVE's pilot\n",
    "\n",
    "EVE will host a pilot session in **September** where you'll have the opportunity to preview the entire system, explore its features, and evaluate how it could support your work as a researcher, student, or professional in the Earth Observation (EO) field. Your feedback will be essential in guiding the final stages of development and ensuring the system meets the real needs of the community.\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "We will demonstrate two key use cases of EVE:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Summarization**: In this task, EVE is given a document related to Earth Observation and asked to generate a concise and informative summary. This is useful for quickly understanding lengthy reports, scientific papers, or satellite data documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question Answering (Q&A)**: In this use case, we enhance EVE’s performance by integrating it with a retrieval system, using a technique known as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Here, the model first retrieves relevant context from a knowledge base before answering questions, leading to more accurate and grounded responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples highlight EVE’s potential to streamline information processing and support decision-making in Earth Observation workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the use case, let’s briefly explore the core idea behind Large Language Models (LLM) and Natural Language Processing (NLP)."

We have \\\\(W^{T}AW=(QW)^{T}(QW)\\\\) so that \\\\(\\\\sigma_{i}(W^{T}AW)=\\\\sigma_{i}^{2}(QW)\\\\) for all \\\\(i\\\\), hence it is equivalent to find a matrix \\\\(A\\\\) such that \\\\(\\\\kappa(W^{T}AW)\\\\) is close to one since it will imply that \\\\(\\\\kappa(QW)\\\\) is close to one, while we can compute a factorization of \\\\(A=Q^{T}Q\\\\) (e.g., a Cholesky decomposition).

    "Chunking is a fundamental step in working with large language models, especially in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines. It refers to the process of splitting long documents or texts into smaller, manageable pieces—called chunks—that can be efficiently stored, indexed, and retrieved when needed. Well-formed chunks are crucial because they ensure that each piece of text contains enough context to be meaningful on its own, which in turn improves the quality of retrieval and the relevance of the information provided to the language model. Poorly chunked text can lead to incomplete or confusing results, so careful design of the chunking strategy is essential.\n"

    "Since we are working with structured documents, we want to avoid blindly splitting the text based solely on character or token length. Instead, we can take advantage of the document’s markdown hierarchy to guide our chunking strategy. By doing so, each chunk will correspond to a logical section of the document—such as a heading and its associated content—making the chunks more coherent and meaningful. This structure-aware approach improves the quality of retrieval and the relevance of the context passed to the language model. We will use LangChain to implement this custom splitting logic efficiently."

    "Total nitrogen concentration (C\\({}_{\\text{TN}}\\)) enrichment is the primary cause of natural water eutrophication. Accurately estimating C\\({}_{\\text{TN}}\\) and its spatiotemporal dynamics is crucial for formulating monitoring and control measures to alleviate lake eutrophication. A hybrid model was proposed for estimating C\\({}_{\\text{TN}}\\) in optically complex inland waters by incorporating the relationship between C\\({}_{\\text{TN}}\\) and water optical active components for Zhuhai-1 Orbita hyperspectral (OHS) imagery. Compared with other semi-analytical algorithms, the re-adjusted reference wavelength QMA's shows the best performance in a(a) retrieval. The hybrid model for C\\({}_{\\text{TN}}\\) estimation achieves an root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.20 mg/L, a mean absolute percentage deviation (MAPD) of 6.96 %, and a unbiased mean absolute percentage deviation (UMAPD) of 6.96 %, with a\\({}_{\\text{DM}}\\)(569) accuracy exerting the greatest influence. Ground-satellite synchronous validation demonstrates robust performance, with an RMSD of 0.28 mg/L, a MAPD of 14.49 %, and a UMAPD of 14.92 %. The hybrid model was applied to OHS observations of Lake Dinch from April 2019 to September 2021. The analysis revealed a generally decreasing trend in C\\({}_{\\text{TN}}\\) during this timeframe. The above results demonstrate that the robustness and applicability of the proposed C\\({}_{\\text{TN}}\\) hybrid model for inland waters with complex optical properties. Furthermore, satellite-based data products provide valuable information for formulating lake management strategies.\n",

    "## 1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Freshwater lakes serve as crucial ecosystems that significantly influence global climate regulation, maintain biodiversity, and provide essential resources for humans (Ho et al., 2019; Li et al., 2024). Human activities, including agricultural runoff and industrial waste discharge, coupled with the effects of global climate change, are causing widespread eutrophication and shrinkage of lakes worldwide (Dai et al., 2023; Grant et al., 2021). Excessive nitrogen elements in aquatic ecosystems have severe adverse effects on aquatic organisms and humans, such as eutrophication, water acidification, and toxicity (Li et al., 2023; Sheikholeslami and Hall, 2023). Therefore, obtaining total nitrogen concentration (C\\({}_{\\text{TN}}\\)) and its spatial distribution is critical for furthering our understanding of the eutrophication process and biogeochemicalprocess of aquatic ecosystems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lake Bianchi is the the largest freshwater lake in Yunnan Province of China. It plays a crucial role in the region's ecological balance, water supply, and economic development (Li et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2023). However, like other reservoirs and lakes around the world, the lake has suffered from severe environmental degradation in recent decades (Feng et al., 2021; Ho et al., 2019). Since the 1970 s, Lake Bianchi has experienced prolonged algal blooms due to increased nitrogen and phosphorus loads, severely affecting the lake's aquatic ecology and the likelihoods of surrounding residents (Cheng et al., 2023; Mu et al., 2021). Therefore, monitoring nutrient concentrations, especially total nitrogen, is crucial for the management of lake eutrophication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, \\(\\mathrm{C_{IN}}\\) monitoring and assessment have relied on field measurements and laboratory analysis (Wang et al., 2022). While these methods provide valuable data points, they are inherently limited in their ability to capture large-scale spatial and temporal variations in \\(\\mathrm{C_{IN}}\\). Additionally, they are both labor-intensive and time-consuming to implement (Cai et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024). Earth observation techniques, with their wide spatial coverage and capability for long-term, continuous monitoring, offer significant potential for uninterrupted water quality monitoring (Liu et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2023). However, accurately estimating \\(\\mathrm{C_{IN}}\\) remains challenging. Unlike optically active substances (OACs), \\(\\mathrm{C_{IN}}\\) lacks a distinct spectral signature within the detectable wavelength range, and TN is therefore referred to as a non-optically active substance (Li et al., 2023; Li et al., 2017). Therefore, estimating \\(\\mathrm{C_{IN}}\\) in inland entropic waters using the spectral features of remote sensing is difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last two decades, researchers have achieved substantial advancements in \\(\\mathrm{C_{IN}}\\) estimation using remote sensing techniques, primarily through direct and indirect estimation models (Chen and Quan, 2012; Dong et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2021; Guo et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Li et al., 2017; Qun'ou et al., 2021; Torbick et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2023). Direct estimation models establish statistical relationships between remote sensing reflectance (\\(\\mathrm{R_{\\mathrm{\\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}}}\\)) and \\(\\mathrm{C_{IN}}\\). Multiple linear regression models have been employed for estimating \\(\\mathrm{C_{IN}}\\) in various water bodies, such as Lake Taihu, the Pearl River Estuary, and the Lower Peninsula of Michigan (Chen and Quan, 2012; Guo et al., 2022; Torbick et al., 2013). Beyond traditional methods, researchers have increasingly focused on leveraging machine learning algorithms for \\(\\mathrm{C_{IN}}\\) estimation. Examples include artificial neural networks, multi-spectral scale morphological combined features, support vector machines, AdaBoost Regression, and Gradient Boosting Regression, which have been trained and successfully applied to \\(\\mathrm{C_{IN}}\\) estimation in inland rivers and lakes (Guo et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023). While direct retrieval models offer advantages in terms of simplicity and ease of use, their effectiveness and applicability across diverse water bodies are significantly constrained by limitations in data availability and the complexity of the relationship between \\(\\mathrm{C_{IN}}\\) and the selected features (Cai et al., 2023). Additionally, the direct use of \\(\\mathrm{R_{\\mathrm{\\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}}}\\)(\\(\\mathrm{\\SIUnitSymbolMicro}\\)) to estimate \\(\\mathrm{C_{IN}}\\) is controversial, as TN is a non-optically active substance, and changes in \\(\\mathrm{C_{IN}}\\) are difficult to reflect in \\(\\mathrm{R_{\\mathrm{\\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}}}\\)(Li et al., 2023). The second type involves indirect estimation models that leverage the relationships between \\(\\mathrm{C_{IN}}\\) and OACs. Chen and Quan (2012) constructed a multiple linear regression model using OACs as predictor variables and \\(\\mathrm{C_{IN}}\\) as the response variable. This model is applicable to \\(\\mathrm{C_{IN}}\\) estimation in Lake Taihu. Previous empirical models only used band ratios or band combination models to estimate \\(\\mathrm{C_{IN}}\\), and such models are difficult to directly apply to different lakes or different periods within the same lake (Oyama et al., 2009). Compared to direct estimation models, indirect models offer the advantage of incorporating bio-optical relationships between \\(\\mathrm{C_{IN}}\\) and OACs. Therefore, we attempted to develop a novel \\(\\mathrm{C_{IN}}\\) estimation model that considers the relationship between \\(\\mathrm{C_{IN}}\\) and the inherent optical properties of water bodies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In optically complex waters, various constituents like phytoplankton, suspended solids, and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) collectively modulate the water's spectral signature, making it challenging to isolate the signal specific to \\(\\mathrm{C_{IN}}\\)(Xue et al., 2019). Additionally, the absorption coefficients of phytoplankton (\\(\\mathrm{a_{\\mathrm{\\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}}}\\)(\\(\\mathrm{\\SIUnitSymbolMicro}\\))), non-algal particles (\\(\\mathrm{a_{\\mathrm{\\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}}}\\)(\\(\\mathrm{\\SIUnitSymbolMicro}\\))), and colored dissolved organic matter (\\(\\mathrm{a_{\\mathrm{\\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}}}\\)(\\(\\mathrm{\\SIUnitSymbolMicro}\\))) quantify how these optically active constituents absorb light particles, thereby reducing the light energy that penetrates the water column. These coefficients serve as the connection between \\(\\mathrm{R_{\\mathrm{\\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}}}\\) and various OACs. Consequently, they are frequently incorporated as intermediary variables within models for estimating various water quality parameters (Liu et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2023). Researchers have proposed various estimation models to estimate these absorption coefficients. These models encompass a range of approaches, including empirical approaches and semi-analytical approaches (Huang et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2020; Xue et al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2023). Building upon existing algorithms like QAA.V5, researchers have developed improved versions specifically designed for different water types. Lee et al. (2014) introduced QAA.V6 for clear ocean applications, utilizing a 670 nm reference wavelength and recalibrated coefficients. This model has proven effective in retrieving inherent optical properties (IOPs) of clear oceans (Jiang et al., 2019; Jorge et al., 2021). For inland turbid waters, modifications like Huang et al. (2014) obtain (using a 710 nm reference wavelength) and Xue et al. (2019) obtain \\(\\mathrm{QAA_{750}}\\) algorithm (using a 750 nm reference wavelength) were developed to address retrieval challenges in these environments. Zheng et al. (2023) proposed a QAA algorithm (\\(\\mathrm{QAA_{710}}\\)) with a reference wavelength of 716 nm and successfully estimated the total absorption coefficient (\\(\\mathrm{a_{\\mathrm{\\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}}}\\)) and \\(\\mathrm{a_{\\mathrm{\\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}}}\\)(\\(\\mathrm{\\SIUnitSymbolMicro}\\)) of Lake Tianchi. These advancements not only enabled IOP retrieval but also facilitated the successful estimation of chlorophyll-a (Chla) and total suspended matter (TSM), contributing to a more comprehensive assessment of inland water quality. Previous studies have demonstrated that using absorption coefficients, rather than OACs, is a more effective and feasible approach for estimating \\(\\mathrm{C_{IN}}\\) in optically complex inland waters (Shi et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2018). Therefore, we attempted to develop a model based on \\(\\mathrm{C_{IN}}\\) and absorption coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study focused on developing a hybrid remote sensing algorithm specifically designed to estimate \\(\\mathrm{C_{IN}}\\) in inland waters with complex optical properties. The proposed hybrid algorithm integrates the improved QAA algorithm and semi-empirical algorithms to estimate absorption coefficients and their relationship with \\(\\mathrm{C_{IN}}\\). The Zhuhai-1 Orbita hyperspectral (OHS) satellite has emerged as a valuable asset for monitoring \\(\\mathrm{C_{IN}}\\) in inland waters. This next-generation satellite boasts exceptional spatial (10 m) and temporal resolution (2.5 days) alongside a high spectral resolution (32 spectral bands). This unique combination allows for the capture of fine-scale spatial and temporal variations in \\(\\mathrm{C_{IN}}\\) across inland aquatic ecosystems. Specifically, we took the following steps: (1) proposed a hybrid model for estimating \\(\\mathrm{C_{IN}}\\) based on absorption coefficients in inland waters; (2) employed the QAA\\({}_{716}\\) model to derive target absorption coefficients; (3) obtained the spatiotemporal variation of \\(\\mathrm{C_{IN}}\\) in Lake Tianchi, a typical eutrophic lake; (4) evaluated the feasibility of using OHS data to estimate \\(\\mathrm{C_{IN}}\\) and conduct a radiation performance assessment.\n",

    "\n",
    "Lake Bianchi, the largest freshwater lake on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, plays a vital role in the regional ecosystem and economy (Fig. 1). It covers an area of approximately 330 km\\({}^{2}\\) with a mean depth of 4.4 m (Huang et al., 2014). Lake Tianchi is a typical tectonic lake with numerous inflowing tributaries and only one outflowing river system, resulting in distinct closed-semi-closed characteristics. Over the past few decades, rapid urbanization and industrial development have led to a sharp deterioration in water quality, with large amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients being discharged into the lake (Li et al., 2023). This has resulted in increasing eutrophication of the lake,leading to large-scale algal blooms under suitable conditions, posing a serious threat to Kunming's tourism industry (Li et al., 2024).\n",

    "### Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "An embeddings model in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a neural network that converts text into dense vector representations (embeddings) in a **high-dimensional space**. These models take text as input and produce a fixed-length array of numbers, a numerical fingerprint of the text's semantic meaning. Embeddings allow search system to find relevant documents not just based on keyword matches, but on semantic understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings models are trained on large text corpora using unsupervised learning techniques. They learn to encode the semantic meaning of words, sentences, and documents in a way that captures relationships between them. For example, embeddings models can learn that \"cat\" and \"dog\" are similar because they are both animals, or that \"apple\" and \"orange\" are similar because they are both fruits.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many pre-trained embedding models available, each suited to different types of data and use cases. For our application, we use [Indus](https://huggingface.co/papers/2405.10725), a fine-tuned encoder-only transformer model trained specifically on scientific journals and articles related to NASA’s Science Mission Directorate (SMD).\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the right embedding model is a critical step in building an effective retrieval system. Ideally, the embedding model should be trained—or at least fine-tuned—on data similar to the target documents. Since our corpus consists of scientific texts focused on Earth Observation, Indus is a better fit than a general-purpose model, as it captures domain-specific terminology and semantics more accurately.\n",

    "When comparing preference scores, both the LLM-as-a-judge model (O4-mini) and human evaluator consistently prefer the answers generated by EVE. For this set of metrics, it's important to emphasize that evaluating open-ended generation is inherently challenging, and each score represents just one perspective on model performance. Among the reported metrics, human and automatic preference scores are the most informative, as they better reflect the overall quality and relevance of the generated answers.\n"
